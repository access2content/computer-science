# Software Development Process
The steps to build a software are:
- Gather the requirements
- Create a high level design
- For each component, create a low level design
- Identify the toughest/most important areas and do the setup
- Write the code

In technical terms:
- Requirement Gathering in Business Requirement Document (BRD)
- Create High-Level Design (HLD)
- Create Low-Level Design (LLD)
- Solve logical problems (DSA)
- Code in Programming Language (Language)

Therefore, there are the above 5 areas when it comes to software development and each one of them needs to be worked upon individually.The learning plan therefore should have something from each area.

# Common Approach
The common approach that people take when becoming an engineer is they select a language/framework and start coding. For example, React Developer, or Node developer, Full Stack Developer, Python Developer, etc.

However, this common approach is not a good approach to becoming a great software developer. To be a good software developer means to understand the problem first, then find a solution, then implement it, then optimize it, then maintain it.

# Better approach
The coding part comes at the end. The first step is to design a good solution and then write the code. However, most people jump directly to code which is why they remain mediocre. This being said, it is also important to write code and to write code really well. So, we cannot just focus on HLD and then LLD and so on. This will take years for one to be a good developer. On the other hand, we cannot just focus on coding first, then look at DSA, then LLD.

To truly become a good developer, all these areas need to be developed simultaneously which is why people usually have lots of problems. There aren't enough guides to teach/explain what to learn and when to learn. This document is an attempt to help me create a learning plan for myself. If it helps someone else too, that is great!

# Mindset
Earlier, I thought that I have to learn XYZ technology, then when something else is hyped, to learn that. This is a never ending cycle. There are just too many things to learn and in the software development field, there is always something new and exciting and better to learn.

However, there are things that are evergreen. There are concepts that you learn only once and use forever in your software development career. These things will never go out of work and will always be relevant, no matter how the technology goes.

For example: 
- Linux is an Operating System, that powers almost all of the Internet. Learning some basics of Linux will get one really far. 
- There are so many GUI tools, but under the hood, the use some system utilities and tools. Learning those allow you to get more work done faster.
- After years of programming, one learns that command line is their best friend and they spend most of their time in the command line. So, it is better to get used to it.
- Your code editor is a tool that you are probably be going to be using throughout your coding journey. So, learning tricks and shortcuts, and how it works saves tons of time in the future.
- Git or any other version control is a tool that you would definitely be using through your entire career.

These and other things are going to be there for your use always. So, it is important to learn them. Learning so many things is not a one day task. It will take years to learn all of these. Therefore, having a plan to learn these without getting overwhelmed and feeling comfortable is important.

Of course, you will learn tools and technologies on your job too, and they are important. Along with that, having a learning plan based on how you see yourself in the next few years is going to set you above the rest.
