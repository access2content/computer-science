# Introduction

A stack is a linear Abstract Data Type (ADT) in which operations for
insertion and deletion are performed only at one end.

The name stack is given to this data type due to the way in which
elements are added and removed from it. Imagine you have a lot of plates
in your home. You would usually put one plate on top of the other when
you want to store the plates. If you want to use a plate, you would
simply pick up a plate from the top and use it. This arrangement of
plates is what we call a stack.

Similar to the stack of plates, we can \"ADD\" an element to the data
type on the TOP and \"REMOVE\" an element from the data type from the
TOP itself. The process of adding an item is termed as PUSH and the
process of removing an item is termed as POP in the stack ADT.

# Operations on a Stack

Since we know that we can add and removed elements to a stack, we can
have a few operations on the stack. Of course not all of them are
compulsory, just a few. The most basic operations required for a stack
are:

-   Push
-   Pop

Other operations include:

-   Peek
-   Check if Empty
-   Check if Full
-   Count elements
-   Edit an element

## Pushing to a stack

To add an element to a stack, we simply insert the element at the top of
the structure.

## Popping from a stack

To remove an element from the stack, we simply remove the top element
from the structure.

## Peeking a stack

We can view the top element in the stack before deciding to push or pop
onto a stack. This is known as peeking.

## Check if empty

We can also check if a stack is empty before trying to remove or add an
element onto the stack.

## Check if full

A stack can have a maximum size limit based on implementation. We can
check if the stack is already at its limit.

## Count Elements

Count the no. of elements on the stack
