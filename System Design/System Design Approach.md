# Spiral Approach
Decide the core of the system (usually database).
This becomes the focus of your system and build other systems around it.

This is used when you are sure what to build.
# Incremental Building
This is used when you are not sure what to build.

- Start with the basic architecture
- See how each component would behave
	- Under Load
	- Under Scale
- Identify the Bottleneck
- Re-architect
