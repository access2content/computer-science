The Singleton Design Pattern aims to keep a check on initialization of objects of a particular class by ensuring that only one instance of the object exists throughout the Java Virtual Machine.

A Singleton class also provides one unique global access point to the object so that each subsequent call to the access point returns only that particular object.
