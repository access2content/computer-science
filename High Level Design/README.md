# Points to remember
- Understand the core property of the system and access pattern instead of a technology
- Affinity towards a technology comes second
- Build an intuition towards building systems
- Any system can be evolved multiple times
- Designing is all about trade-offs. So, always think, is there anything we can improve?
- There are only 4 things in computers - Memory, CPU, Disk, and Network
