A tree is a data structure where a node can have zero or more children. Each node contains a value. These data structures are called “trees” because the data structure resembles a tree. It starts with a root node and branch off with its descendants, and finally, there are leaves.

- It is not a linear Data Structure.
- It has a parent-child relation

# Properties of Trees
## Root
The top-most node is called root.

## Leaf Node
A node without children is called leaf node or terminal node.

## Height
Height (h) of the tree is the distance (edge count) between the farthest leaf to the root.
- A has a height of 3
- I has a height of 0

## Depth/Level
Depth or level of a node is the distance between the root and the node in question.
- H has a depth of 2
- B has a depth of 1

## Edge
The connection between nodes is called edge.

# Applications
Tree data structures have many applications such as:

- Maps
- Sets
- Databases
- Priority Queues
- Querying an LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol)
- Representing the Document Object Model (DOM) for HTML on Websites.
